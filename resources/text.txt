How could you let me fall?
You said that I was your everything
But did you mean it at all?
I'm left to pick up the pieces what's left of my heart
You rip me apart
Why is this so hard?
I know I deserve more than this
Yet I still crave your love
I'm your blood and you use me like a drug
Well enough is enough

I've been waiting forever for you to change
I can't do this forever not one more day
Never wanted to lose you this way
But you're stuck
Stuck in your ways

Where will you go?
I was the one who held you up whenever you were low
I was the only one who refused to see
That this is the real you
